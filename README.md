# drug-combination-app
A web app that allows users to check for dangerous drug interactions for harm reduction purposes. It's a rebuild of https://combo.tripsit.me/ with improved UI.

The application uses the drug combination JSON file by TripSit originastion, as found [here](https://github.com/TripSit/drugs/blob/main/combos.json).
